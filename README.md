# Final_Assessment
* Self-Assessment *

  For the assignment the first and second week was good, we all talked and figured out what we were doing. At first we were confident in what we were drop and why we were dropping it and that made us see that the question was straight forward. After the second week we saw that we as a team were asking different question and we got back on track. The question was will your flight be delayed or not, and we were adding to that by thinking that we can add how long is your delay? Once we realized as a team that we were moving away from the original question we went back.

  The data set didn't have the best explainations about the features and that made us drop a major feature, such could of helped us better in the end if we wanted to produce more. What we could of done was tell the customer what time of day is best where the delays are not requent, and then what day of the week is the best to not get frequent delays.

  As a a team we helped eachother with questions we had, to the best of our ability and with our different time scheldules.

  The presentation was done well by our teammates, they explained the content to the best was what the data was saying. What we could of said better was bring in the insight of what can cause a delay of a flight and what could happen. This information doesn't come from the dataset, but come from the information that we could of looked up on the internet. Neither the less we did bring in points about the dataset and our code which are good.
